Neuro-Symbolic Fortran Library

## Introduction
Welcome to nerofort! This library is a work-in-progress implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Fortran, inspired by the instructions provided in [Python and Machine Learning](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/intro.html). Currently, the project is being developed using Approximatrix Simply Fortran, with the intention of expanding its capabilities and improving various aspects of the implementation.

## Features
- Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Fortran.
- Work is ongoing, with many areas slated for improvement and completion.
- Building in Approximatrix Simply Fortran for ease of development.
- Future plans include implementing a symbolic neural network, creating wrappers for Java and Python for seamless integration, extending functionality, refining core functions for better performance, and adding support for CMAKE.

## Getting Started
To get started with nerofort, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Approximatrix Simply Fortran if you haven't already.
3. Explore the source code to understand the implementation of the convolutional neural network.
4. Experiment with the code, contribute improvements, or report any issues you encounter.

## Future Plans
- Implement a symbolic neural network.
- Create wrappers for Java and Python to facilitate communication with the models.
- Extend functionality to support additional features.
- Refine core functions to improve performance.
- Add support for CMAKE to streamline the build process.
