Neuro-Symbolic Fortran Library

## Introduction
Welcome to nerofort! This library is a work-in-progress implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Fortran, inspired by the instructions provided in [Python and Machine Learning](https://pythonandml.github.io/dlbook/content/intro.html). The project is currently being developed using CMake, with efforts focused on integrating Python preprocessing to enhance its capabilities and refine various aspects of the implementation.

## Features
- Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Fortran.
- Work is ongoing, with many areas slated for improvement and completion.
- Building in Approximatrix Simply Fortran for ease of development.
- Future plans include implementing a symbolic neural network, creating wrappers for Java and Python for seamless integration, extending functionality, refining core functions for better performance.

## Requirements

 -   Fortran 2008 compliant compiler
 -   CMake
 -   Make
 -   fypp
### Build
```
cmake -B build
```

## Getting Started
To get started with nerofort, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the build dependencies (for example, with ```pip``` or ```conda```)
3. Explore the source code to understand the implementation of the convolutional neural network.
4. Experiment with the code, contribute improvements, or report any issues you encounter.

## Future Plans
- Work is in progress, so the priority is to finish the core functionalities.
- Implement a symbolic neural network.
- Create wrappers for Java and Python to facilitate communication with the models.
- Extend functionality to support additional features.
- Refine core functions to improve performance.
